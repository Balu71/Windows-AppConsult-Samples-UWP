# Using Windows ML in your Windows application
This sample shows how to leverage the WinML APIs, introduced in Windows 10 1803, to perform object recognition given an image. This specific sample leverages a ONNX model which detects if the image contains a plane. The model has been generated and trained using the [Custom Vision service](https://customvision.ai) provided by Azure. 

The sample project contains a UWP app and a WPF app packaged with the Desktop Bridge, sharing the same model.
